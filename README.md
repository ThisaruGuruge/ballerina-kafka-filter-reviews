# BALLERINA-KAFKA-FILTER-REVIEWS

THIS IS A SAMPLE BALLERINA APPLICATION TO DEMONSTRATE HOW TO USE   `BALLERINA-KAFKA` MODULE WITH `APACHE KAFKA` TO DEVELOP A COURSE REVIEW FILTERING SYSTEM.

THE SYSTEM IS TAKING USER REVIEWS ON COURSES, USING A BALLERINA HTTP ENDPOINT, AND THEN PUBLISH THEM INTO A KAFKA TOPIC. THEN THE REVIEWS ARE FILTERED OUT, BY THEIR NATURE: FRAUDULENT OR NOT.

FRAUDULENT REVIEWS ARE PUBLISHED TO ANOTHER KAFKA TOPIC TO PROCESS FURTHER, WHILE NON-FRAUDULENT REVIEWS ARE PUBLISHED INTO ANOTHER KAFKA TOPIC, INORDER TO PUBLISH THEM IN THE SITE ITSELF.

HERE WE ARE NOT LOOKING INTO DETAILS ABOUT HOW TO DECIDE A REVIEW IS FRAUDULENT OR HOW WE ARE TO PUBLISH THE REVIEWS IN THE SITE. RATHER, WE ARE LOOKING INTO HOW WE CAN USE BALLERINA-KAFKA TO FILTER AND PUBLISH REVIEWS SEPARATELY TO DIFFERENT TOPICS, INORDER TO PROCESS THE, SEPARATELY. 

THIS 4 DIFFERENT COMPONENTS:

* PRE-PROCESS REVIEWS
* FILTER REVIEWS
* HANDLE ACCEPTED REVIEWS
* HANDLE REJECTED REVIEWS
